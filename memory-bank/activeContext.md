# Active Context - Current Focus

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS: MoveGuard Grid System Modified to Start from Level 1 ‚úÖ

### **Latest Achievement: MoveGuard Grid System Modified to Start from Level 1**
- **Modification**: Changed grid system to start from grid level 1 instead of grid level 0
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Grid levels now start from 1 to 5 instead of 0 to 4
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Grid system now starts from level 1 as requested by user

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Grid Level Calculation**: Updated `_get_next_grid_level()` to start from level 1
2. **Price Calculation**: Modified price calculation to use `(target_level - 1)` for proper spacing
3. **Validation Logic**: Updated grid level validation to expect levels 1 to 5
4. **Retry Logic**: Updated retry calculations to use correct level-based pricing
5. **Debug Logging**: Updated comments and logging to reflect new level numbering

üéØ **System Benefits**:
- **Before**: Grid levels started from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **After**: Grid levels start from 1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- **Before**: Price calculation used `target_level` directly
- **After**: Price calculation uses `(target_level - 1)` for proper spacing
- **Before**: Validation expected levels 0 to 4
- **After**: Validation expects levels 1 to 5
- **Result**: Grid system now starts from level 1 as requested

üìç **Code Locations**:
- **Grid Level Calculation**: Updated `_get_next_grid_level()` method (lines 3737-3753)
- **Grid Level Validation**: Updated `_validate_pending_orders_grid_levels()` method (lines 3755-3794)
- **BUY Price Calculation**: Updated BUY order price calculation (line 3858)
- **SELL Price Calculation**: Updated SELL order price calculation (line 3932)
- **BUY Retry Logic**: Updated BUY retry calculations (lines 3884, 3891)
- **SELL Retry Logic**: Updated SELL retry calculations (lines 3958, 3966)
- **Debug Logging**: Updated comments and logging to reflect new level numbering

### **Previous Achievement: MoveGuard Zone Boundary Distance Fixed**
- **Issue**: Distance between upper and lower boundary should always be zone_threshold_pips, but sometimes it was zone_threshold_pips * 2
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Zone boundaries now always have correct distance of zone_threshold_pips
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Zone boundaries now have correct distance instead of being doubled

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Corrected Formula**: Changed from `zone_threshold_pips * pip_value` to `(zone_threshold_pips * pip_value) / 2`
2. **Distance Validation**: Added validation to ensure boundaries always have correct distance
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Clear logging shows calculated distance vs expected distance
4. **Comprehensive Fix**: Applied to all boundary calculation locations in the codebase
5. **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive validation prevents invalid boundary calculations

üéØ **System Benefits**:
- **Before**: Zone boundaries had distance of `zone_threshold_pips * 2` (doubled)
- **After**: Zone boundaries have correct distance of `zone_threshold_pips`
- **Before**: Zone boundaries were twice as wide as expected
- **After**: Zone boundaries are exactly the expected width
- **Result**: Correct zone behavior and proper trading logic

üìç **Code Locations**:
- **Initial Zone Creation**: Fixed in `_create_cycle_from_pocketbase` and `_create_cycle_config_snapshot` (lines 1407-1408, 1433-1434)
- **Zone Movement**: Fixed in `_move_zone` method for both UP and DOWN directions (lines 4906-4907, 4911-4912)
- **Bounds Update**: Fixed in `_update_bounds_after_all_orders_closed` method (lines 4782-4783, 4792-4793, 4798-4799, 4804-4805, 4810-4811)
- **Zone Detection**: Fixed in `_check_zone_movement` method initialization (lines 4848-4849)
- **Boundary Calculation**: Fixed in main boundary calculation logic (lines 3002-3004)

### **Previous Achievement: MoveGuard Order Movement from Pending to Active Orders**
- **Feature**: Orders now move from `self.pending_orders` to `self.orders` when activated
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Complete order movement system with dual tracking implemented
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Proper order lifecycle management with dual tracking system for better data consistency

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Dual Tracking**: Pending orders are stored in both `cycle.pending_orders` and `cycle.orders` with status 'pending'
2. **Activation Detection**: System detects when pending orders become active positions in MT5
3. **Status Update**: Order status changes from 'pending' to 'active' in main orders list
4. **List Management**: Order removed from `pending_orders` but remains in main `orders` list
5. **Database Sync**: Changes are synced to PocketBase for persistence

üéØ **System Benefits**:
- **Before**: Pending orders only tracked in `pending_orders` list
- **After**: Pending orders tracked in both lists with proper status transitions
- **Before**: No clear order lifecycle from pending to active
- **After**: Complete order lifecycle tracking with status management
- **Result**: Better order management, data consistency, and cycle tracking

üìç **Code Locations**:
- **Order Creation**: Enhanced to add orders to both lists (lines 3972-3976)
- **Order Activation**: Enhanced `_update_pending_order_on_trigger()` method (lines 4356-4392)
- **Database Sync**: Added PocketBase synchronization for order status changes

### **Previous Achievement: MoveGuard Cycle Status Management - Keep Cycles Open When No Active Orders**
- **Issue**: Cycles were being automatically closed when there were no active orders
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Cycles now remain open even when all orders are closed
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Cycles no longer automatically close when all orders hit stop loss, maintaining trading opportunities

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Removed Automatic Closure**: Eliminated logic that automatically closed cycles when no active orders exist
2. **Cycle Continuity**: Cycles now remain in "active" status even when all orders are closed
3. **Pending Order Cleanup**: Pending orders are still properly cleaned up but cycle stays open
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Clear logging shows cycles remain open for potential future orders
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Cycles only close for specific reasons (take profit, manual closure, events)

üéØ **System Benefits**:
- **Before**: Cycles automatically closed when all orders hit stop loss
- **After**: Cycles remain open even when all orders are closed
- **Before**: Lost trading opportunities due to premature cycle closure
- **After**: Cycles can potentially place new orders in the future
- **Result**: Better cycle continuity and trading opportunity preservation

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_check_and_cleanup_closed_orders()` - Modified cycle closure logic (lines 4660-4672)
- Removed complex grid restart logic that would close cycles on failure
- Enhanced logging for cycle status decisions

### **Previous Achievement: MoveGuard Trailing Stop Loss NoneType Comparison Errors Fixed**
- **Issue**: TypeError when comparing `cycle.trailing_stop_loss` with float values due to None values
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Added proper None checks for all trailing_stop_loss comparisons
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Eliminated grid logic processing crashes and system instability
- **Critical Fix**: Fixed boundary calculation logic that was producing invalid zone boundaries (upper=100.0, lower=0.0)

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **None Check Implementation**: Added `cycle.trailing_stop_loss is not None` checks before all comparisons
2. **Boundary Calculation Fix**: Fixed all movement modes to use proper zone spacing instead of setting `new_upper = new_base`
3. **Enhanced Validation**: Changed boundary validation from `new_upper == 0 or new_lower == 0` to `new_upper <= new_lower`
4. **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive None checks prevent future comparison errors
5. **Code Quality**: Enhanced error handling and validation throughout the codebase

üéØ **System Benefits**:
- **Before**: TypeError crashes when comparing None values with floats
- **After**: Robust None checks prevent all comparison errors
- **Before**: Invalid boundary calculations (upper=100.0, lower=0.0)
- **After**: Proper zone spacing with valid upper > lower relationships
- **Result**: Stable grid logic processing without crashes

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_process_grid_logic()` - Added None checks for trailing_stop_loss comparisons (lines 1875, 1886, 1891)
- `_update_bounds_after_all_orders_closed()` - Fixed boundary calculation logic (lines 4754-4777)
- All movement modes now use proper zone spacing instead of invalid boundary calculations
- Enhanced error handling and validation throughout the codebase

#### **Critical Bug Fixes Applied**:
1. **NoneType Comparison Error**: 
   - **Issue**: `cycle.trailing_stop_loss` can be `None`, causing "TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'" errors
   - **Fix**: Added `cycle.trailing_stop_loss is not None` checks before all comparisons
   - **Result**: Eliminated TypeError crashes and ensured stable grid logic processing

2. **Invalid Boundary Calculation Error**:
   - **Issue**: Boundary calculation was setting `new_upper = new_base` and `new_lower = new_base`, causing invalid boundaries (upper=100.0, lower=0.0)
   - **Fix**: Fixed all movement modes to use proper zone spacing with `new_upper = new_base + (zone_threshold_pips * pip_value)` and `new_lower = new_base - (zone_threshold_pips * pip_value)`
   - **Result**: Eliminated invalid boundary errors and ensured proper zone spacing

### **Previous Achievement: Fixed Critical Grid Restart Direction Determination**
- **Issue**: Grid restart logic was using old cycle direction instead of determining new direction based on current price boundaries
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Grid restart now properly determines direction based on current price boundaries
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Eliminates incorrect order direction during grid restarts and ensures proper direction reversal

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Direction Determination Logic**: Added proper direction determination logic to grid restart process
2. **Price Boundary Analysis**: Analyzes current price vs zone boundaries (upper + initial_offset, lower - initial_offset)
3. **Direction Updates**: Updates `cycle.direction` to the newly determined direction
4. **Order Placement**: Places new initial orders with correct direction based on current market conditions
5. **Fallback Logic**: Maintains existing direction when price is within zone boundaries

üéØ **System Stability Benefit**:
- **Before**: Grid restart used old cycle direction, potentially placing orders in wrong direction
- **After**: Grid restart determines new direction based on current price boundaries
- **Before**: Could place BUY orders when market reversed to SELL, or vice versa
- **After**: Automatically determines correct direction based on current market conditions
- **Result**: Proper direction reversal and correct order placement during grid restarts

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_check_and_cleanup_closed_orders()` - Enhanced grid restart direction determination logic (lines 4408-4428)
- Direction determination logic compares current price with upper/lower boundaries plus offset
- Cycle direction update ensures consistency between cycle direction and placed orders

### **Previous Achievement: Fixed Critical Format String Error in Pending Order Monitoring**
- **Issue**: "unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__" errors in pending order monitoring
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Added null checks and safe formatting for target_price variables
- **Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Impact**: Eliminates repeated format string errors and improves system stability

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Root Cause**: `target_price` variable could be `None` but was being formatted with `.5f` in logging statements
2. **Error Location**: Lines 4014, 4062, 4065 in `_monitor_pending_orders()` method
3. **Fix Applied**: Added null checks and safe fallback values for target_price formatting
4. **Safety Measures**: Added `target_price and` conditions before price comparisons
5. **Fallback Values**: Used `target_price or 0.0` for safe formatting

üéØ **System Stability Benefit**:
- **Before**: Repeated "unsupported format string" errors every few seconds during order monitoring
- **After**: Clean order monitoring with proper null handling
- **Result**: Improved system reliability and reduced error log noise

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_monitor_pending_orders()` - Added null checks for target_price formatting (lines 4014, 4062, 4065)
- Enhanced safety with `target_price_safe = target_price or 0.0` fallback pattern

### **Previous Achievement: System Now Handles Activated Pending Orders During Cycle Closure**
- **Issue**: Failed to cancel pending orders when cycle hits TP because they were activated as market orders
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - System now searches for activated pending orders as market orders and closes them
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Impact**: Eliminates "Failed to cancel pending order" errors and ensures complete cycle closure

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Activation Detection**: When pending order cancellation fails, system searches for the order as a market position
2. **Status Conversion**: Converts activated pending orders from 'pending' to 'active' status
3. **Data Management**: Removes from pending orders list and adds to active orders list
4. **Proper Closure**: Activated orders are then closed as regular active orders during cycle closure
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Clear distinction between regular active orders and activated pending orders

üéØ **Reliability Benefit**:
- **Before**: "Failed to cancel pending order" errors when orders were activated by market
- **After**: System detects activation and properly handles activated orders as market positions
- **Result**: Complete cycle closure with all orders properly closed

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_cancel_cycle_pending_orders()` - Enhanced with activation detection (lines 3858-3886)
- `_close_cycle_on_take_profit()` - Enhanced with activated order tracking (lines 4533-4558)

### **Previous Achievement: Stop Loss Sync Timing Fixed**
- **Issue**: First order's stop loss was being removed when second order was placed, not when it got activated
- **Impact**: First order lost its stop loss protection too early in the cycle
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - First order now keeps its stop loss until second order actually gets activated
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Fix**: Modified stop loss sync to trigger on order activation, not order placement

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Before**: When grid level 1 order was placed, it immediately synced grid level 0's stop loss
2. **After**: Grid level 0 keeps its original stop loss until grid level 1 order actually gets activated (executed)
3. **Activation Detection**: Uses `_update_pending_order_on_trigger()` to detect when pending orders become active positions
4. **Sync Trigger**: Stop loss sync now happens in `_sync_grid_0_sl_on_activation()` when grid level 1 gets activated
5. **Risk Management**: First order maintains its protection until second order is actually in the market

üéØ **Risk Management Benefit**:
- **Before**: First order lost stop loss protection as soon as second order was placed (even if not executed)
- **After**: First order keeps stop loss protection until second order is actually activated and trading
- **Result**: Better risk management with proper stop loss timing

üìç **Code Locations**:
- **Strategy/MoveGuard.py**: 
  - Removed automatic SL sync from `_place_grid_buy_order()` and `_place_grid_sell_order()` (lines 3416-3417, 3582-3583)
  - Added activation-based sync in `_update_pending_order_on_trigger()` (lines 3947-3949)
  - Created new `_sync_grid_0_sl_on_activation()` method (lines 5592-5662)
  - Deprecated old `_sync_grid_0_sl_with_grid_1()` method (lines 5664+)

### **Previous Achievement: Critical SELL_STOP Order Placement Fix**
- **Issue**: SELL_STOP orders failing with MetaTrader error 10015 - prices too close to current market
- **Impact**: Complete SELL order placement failure resolved, system now places SELL orders correctly
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - SELL_STOP orders now placed at proper prices below current market
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Fix**: Added 10 pip offset below current price for SELL_STOP orders to ensure valid placement

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Initial Order**: Converted from market order to pending order (BUY_STOP/SELL_STOP at current price)
2. **Grid Maintenance**: System maintains next 3 grid levels as pending orders ahead of current position
3. **Mixed Order Types**: Auto-selects BUY_STOP/BUY_LIMIT or SELL_STOP/SELL_LIMIT based on price position relative to target
4. **Grid Restart**: Cancels all pending orders and places new ones from restart price for clean restart
5. **SL Management**: Pending orders keep initial SL, only active positions get updated trailing SL

üéØ **System Benefits**:
- **Before**: Market orders with slippage risk, bot must be active during price movements
- **After**: Pending orders execute at exact grid levels, broker handles execution automatically
- **Result**: Precise grid execution, no slippage, reduced bot processing load

üìç **Code Locations**:
- **MetaTrader/MT5.py**: Added `cancel_pending_order()`, `place_pending_buy_order()`, `place_pending_sell_order()` (lines 781-896)
- **Strategy/MoveGuard.py**: 
  - Pending order management methods (lines 3596-3850)
  - Initial order conversion to pending (lines 2008-2127)
  - Grid logic replacement with pending order system (lines 1891-1913)
  - Grid restart with pending order cancellation (lines 1803-1810)

#### **Critical Bug Fixes Applied**:
1. **SL Validation**: Fixed invalid SL values (50.0 pips) being passed as prices - now validates SL is proper price value
2. **Result Extraction**: Enhanced order ID extraction to handle different MT5 result formats (dict, object, NamedTuple)
3. **Error Handling**: Added proper validation for SL calculations and order placement failures
4. **MT5 Error 10016**: Fixed "Request rejected" errors by validating order parameters before placement
5. **Infinite Pending Orders**: Fixed continuous placement of pending orders - now only places exact number needed (3 levels)
6. **Pending Order Cleanup**: Added automatic cancellation of all pending orders when cycles close (take profit, manual close, events)
7. **PocketBase Integration**: Added full pending order persistence to PocketBase with duplicate prevention and cross-session recovery

#### **PocketBase Integration Features**:
- **Pending Order Persistence**: All pending orders stored in PocketBase `cycles` collection
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks PocketBase before placing new pending orders
- **Cross-Session Recovery**: Pending orders restored when bot restarts
- **Real-time Sync**: Pending orders synced to PocketBase on every change
- **Cycle Closure Cleanup**: Pending orders automatically removed from PocketBase when cycles close

#### **Status Tracking Features**:
- **MT5 Status Monitoring**: Real-time checking of pending order status in MT5
- **Status Lifecycle**: Proper transitions from 'pending' ‚Üí 'active' ‚Üí 'closed'
- **Cancellation Handling**: Status updated to 'cancelled' when orders are cancelled
- **Trigger Detection**: Automatic detection when pending orders become active positions
- **Dual Tracking**: Orders tracked in both `cycle.pending_orders` and `cycle.orders` lists

### **Previous Achievement: Grid Restart Price Continuity Fixed**
- **Issue**: When movement mode is "NO move" or "Move down only" and price keeps going up, grid orders were placed at original boundary prices instead of current price after restart
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Grid restart now uses current price as new grid start point
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Impact**: Proper grid spacing maintained when cycles restart after all orders are closed

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Grid Restart Detection**: System detects when all orders are closed and cycle needs to restart grid placement
2. **Movement Mode Check**: Only applies to "No Move" and "Move Down Only" modes where boundaries don't move
3. **Restart Price Tracking**: Stores current price as `grid_restart_start_price` when restart is detected
4. **Price Continuity**: Uses restart price instead of original boundary calculation for new grid orders
5. **Proper Spacing**: Maintains `grid_interval_pips` spacing from the restart price for all subsequent levels

üéØ **Grid Behavior Benefit**:
- **Before**: Grid restarted from original upper boundary, causing multiple orders at same price
- **After**: Grid restarts from current price, maintaining proper interval spacing
- **Result**: No duplicate orders at same price, proper grid formation continues

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_process_grid_logic()` - Grid restart detection and price calculation (lines 1796-1806, 1874-1888, 1922-1936)
- Initial order placement - Uses restart price for first order after restart
- Subsequent grid orders - Uses restart price as reference for all levels

### **Previous Achievement: Order Price Field Now Uses Actual MT5 Executed Price**
- **Issue**: Order price field in order_info was using parameter value instead of actual MT5 open price
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Order price now uses actual open price from MT5 result
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Impact**: PocketBase now receives accurate price data instead of intended parameter values

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Root Cause**: MoveGuard was setting `order_info.price = order_price` (parameter) instead of `result['order']['price_open']` (actual executed price)
2. **Fix Applied**: Updated all three order placement methods to use `result['order'].get('price_open', order_price)`
3. **Fallback Safety**: Added fallback to parameter price if MT5 result is incomplete
4. **Data Accuracy**: PocketBase now receives actual executed prices, accounting for slippage
5. **Consistency**: Ensures cycle data in PocketBase matches actual MT5 order data

üéØ **Data Integrity Benefit**:
- **Before**: PocketBase received intended price (parameter value)
- **After**: PocketBase receives actual executed price from MT5 result
- **Result**: Accurate price data for profit calculations and cycle analysis

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_place_initial_order()` - Fixed initial order price (line 1978)
- `_place_grid_buy_order()` - Fixed BUY grid order price (line 3263)
- `_place_grid_sell_order()` - Fixed SELL grid order price (line 3430)

### **Previous Achievement: Expected SL Calculation Now Matches Trailing SL Logic**
- **Issue**: Expected SL calculation was using simple fixed calculation instead of trailing SL logic with movement mode
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Expected SL now uses same logic as trailing SL calculation
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Impact**: Risk management consistency - expected SL now matches actual trailing SL behavior

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Unified Calculation**: Created `_calculate_expected_sl_price()` method that uses same logic as trailing SL
2. **Movement Mode Integration**: Expected SL properly considers all movement modes (`Move Both Sides`, `Move Up Only`, `Move Down Only`, `No Move`)
3. **Zone Boundary Capping**: Expected SL capped at zone boundaries when movement mode requires it
4. **Price References**: Uses `highest_buy_price`/`lowest_sell_price` when available, falls back to entry_price
5. **Zone Threshold**: Uses `zone_threshold_pips` for consistent calculation with trailing SL

üéØ **Risk Management Benefit**:
- **Before**: Expected SL used simple fixed calculation (entry_price ¬± initial_stop_loss_pips)
- **After**: Expected SL uses same logic as trailing SL (considering movement mode, zone boundaries, highest/lowest prices)
- **Result**: Consistent risk management behavior between expected SL and actual trailing SL

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_calculate_expected_sl_price()` - New unified SL calculation method (lines 2059-2130)
- `_check_and_enforce_interval_order_sl()` - Updated to use unified calculation (lines 2226-2227)

### **Previous Achievement: Grid 0 Stop Loss Auto-Sync with Grid 1**
- **Feature**: Grid level 0 order's stop loss automatically syncs with grid level 1's stop loss when grid 1 is placed
- **Purpose**: Tightens risk on initial order once first grid order is placed
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Automatic SL synchronization working for both BUY and SELL cycles
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Impact**: Better risk management by reducing initial order's stop loss when grid starts forming

#### **Implementation Details**
üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Grid 1 Placement**: When grid level 1 order is placed (BUY or SELL)
2. **SL Extraction**: Grid 1's stop loss value is captured
3. **Grid 0 Lookup**: System finds the active grid level 0 order in the cycle
4. **MetaTrader Update**: Grid 0's SL is modified via `modify_position_sl_tp()` to match Grid 1's SL
5. **Data Sync**: Order data in cycle is updated to reflect the new SL

üéØ **Risk Management Benefit**:
- **Before**: Grid 0 has wider initial stop loss (e.g., 300 pips)
- **After Grid 1**: Grid 0's SL tightens to match Grid 1's trailing SL
- **Result**: Reduced risk on initial position once grid formation begins

üìç **Code Locations**:
- `_place_grid_buy_order()` - Calls sync after grid 1 placement (line 3256-3257)
- `_place_grid_sell_order()` - Calls sync after grid 1 placement (line 3423-3424)  
- `_sync_grid_0_sl_with_grid_1()` - Implementation (lines 4880-4933)

### **Previous Achievement: Order Timestamp Preservation Implemented**
- **Issue**: All orders in MoveGuard cycles had the same datetime stamp instead of their actual MT5 open times
- **Root Cause**: Field mapping didn't include MT5's `time_setup` field, causing fallback to `datetime.now()`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Orders now preserve their actual MT5 timestamps
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Impact**: Accurate order tracking and proper cycle analysis with real order times

### **Previous Achievement: Bot-Broker Order Closure Separation Implemented**
- **Issue**: Bot was manually closing orders when SL was hit instead of letting broker handle it
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Bot now only depends on broker for SL closures, only closes cycles at TP
- **Date**: 2025-10-12
- **Impact**: Clean separation of responsibilities between bot and broker

### **Datetime Fix Details**
üìå **Problem**: All MoveGuard orders had identical timestamps
- **Root Cause**: `_convert_object_to_order_data()` didn't map MT5's `time_setup` field
- **Consequence**: All orders fell back to `datetime.now()` resulting in same timestamp
- **Impact**: Made cycle analysis impossible, couldn't track real order timing
- **User Discovery**: Found via MCP query showing all orders with identical datetime

üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**: 
- **Added MT5 Fields**: Added `time_setup`, `time_setup_msc`, `time` to field mappings
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Created `_convert_timestamp_to_iso()` to convert Unix timestamps to ISO format
- **Preserved Original**: Enhanced extraction to prefer MT5 timestamps over `datetime.now()`
- **Type Safety**: Handles datetime objects, Unix timestamps, and ISO strings
- **Fallback Logic**: Only uses current time if all timestamp extraction attempts fail

### **Order Closing Behavior Fix Details**
üìå **Problem**: MoveGuard strategy was manually closing orders when stop loss threshold was hit
- **Manual Order Closing**: Bot was calling `self._close_order(order)` when SL threshold was detected
- **Broker Competition**: Bot competing with broker to close orders at SL
- **Timing Issues**: Potential double-closure attempts and conflicts
- **User Requirement**: Only broker should close orders at SL, bot should only close cycles at TP

üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**: 
- **Removed Manual Closing**: Removed `self._close_order(order)` call when SL threshold is hit (line 2256)
- **Broker Delegation**: Bot now logs SL hits but lets broker handle the actual closure
- **Kept SL Enforcement**: Bot still adds SL to orders that don't have it (ensures protection)
- **Kept Cycle TP Closing**: Bot still closes entire cycles when take profit target is reached
- **Clean Monitoring**: Bot monitors SL hits without interfering with broker's closure process

### **Implementation Results** ‚úÖ
- **Individual Order SL**: Broker closes orders when stop loss is hit (not the bot)
- **Order Protection**: Bot still adds SL to orders that don't have it
- **Cycle Take Profit**: Bot closes entire cycle (all orders) when cycle TP target is reached
- **Clean Monitoring**: Bot logs when SL threshold is hit without interfering
- **No Conflicts**: No more competition between bot and broker for order closure
- **Proper Separation**: Clear separation of responsibilities between bot and broker

### **Behavior Changes**
| Function | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Order SL Hits** | ‚ùå Bot manually closes order | ‚úÖ Broker closes order |
| **Orders Without SL** | ‚úÖ Bot adds SL | ‚úÖ Bot adds SL (unchanged) |
| **Cycle TP Reached** | ‚úÖ Bot closes cycle | ‚úÖ Bot closes cycle (unchanged) |
| **SL Monitoring** | ‚úÖ Bot monitors | ‚úÖ Bot monitors (unchanged) |
